# GTNBRG
Join and Host Book Clubs
<hr>

<strong>Purpose:</strong>

The purpose of GTNBRG is to allow our users to Join and Host book clubs. Users can join clubs that are hosted by others and can create their own book club if they want to. The host can set discussion dates and times, and search the open library api to choose a book for their club.

<strong>Functionality:</strong>

On our homepage, users can click links to sign up or login. When logged in users can also find a link to the clubs page. 

Users can navigate the site with the navbar allowing them to return to the homepage, view clubs, login, and signup. When logged in, the login and signup links are hidden and a Welcome link and logout link are available allowing them to look at their profile page with links to all clubs they have joined and log out of GTNBRG.

On our clubs page users can click view details links to each club, where they can join a new club after viewing the club's individual page. 

Users can create their own clubs by filling out the new club form and becoming a club host, after which they can pick out a book  by filling out the form and a book cover will be visible if it was in the Open Library api. The host is also able to choose a discussion date and time. 

On the profile page, links are available to logged in members who have joined clubs. Links to individual club pages are available.

On all pages, users can navigate using our navigation bar (Desktop), and our Navigation dropdown burger (Mobile). Using bulma and css we were able to present users with a polished User Interface, making their transition from our site external recipe pages as seemless as possible.

<strong>Goals Accomplished:</strong>

Users are able to sign up and log in to GTNBRG. Users can join book clubs that are already a part of our database, and create their own book clubs. The member's profile page allows them to navigate to the clubs they've joined with ease.
